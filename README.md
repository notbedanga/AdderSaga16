## **Implementations**

### **1. Behavioral 16-bit Adder**
- Simplest implementation using Verilogâ€™s `+` operator.
- Suitable for quick prototyping and understanding high-level modeling.

---

### **2. Structural 16-bit Ripple Carry Adder (RCA)**
- A gate-level structural design built using chained **full adders**.
- Simple to understand but slower due to sequential carry propagation.

---

### **3. Structural 16-bit Carry Lookahead Adder (CLA)**
- High-performance structural design with **parallel carry computation**.
- Significantly faster than RCA for larger bit-widths.
